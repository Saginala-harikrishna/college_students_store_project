📘 Smart Store Management System – README

A full‑stack web application built to digitize and streamline college store operations. This system provides separate portals for **students** and **admins**, enabling fast, transparent, and efficient management of purchases, balances, students, and inventory.



🧩 Project Overview

The Smart Store Management System was built to replace the slow and error‑prone manual store process in college, where activation, billing, verification, and record‑keeping were entirely paper‑based. The system brings complete digital transformation by introducing online student accounts, admin‑controlled billing, automated reporting, and real‑time balance tracking.
